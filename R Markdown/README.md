# R Markdown

## Tasks

- bugs.Rmd

    This is a debugging task, in which participants seek to find and resolve specific code errors. Clues for this can be found by opening an R Markdown script in RStudio, which creates a template that includes the YAML header and some examples of text formatting and R Markdown coding. By looking at that template, and by also following the workshop demo, participants can rise to this challenge.

- example of HTML and CSS use.png

    See code in the document 'example of HTML and CSS use'. To render that code as an HTML document yourself, you may copy the code into an R Markdown document in RStudio, or into a [hackmd.io document] online.
